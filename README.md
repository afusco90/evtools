If you come up with cool ideas on how to extend some of the things these tools do i'd love to hear about them.

Note: On 8/15/19 Tesla removed the mysolarcity.com site data so the SolarCity polling tool no longer works. They have not provided an API or Tesla-based site to get your system data, only via the Tesla mobile app is this data available. Please join me in contacting Tesla to make this data available on the web again.
